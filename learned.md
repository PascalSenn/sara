Things I've Learned
=====================

# General Things

* Man pages probably won't help you conceptually understand a(n) (X)lib.
* Drawing is probably the best tool I have for debugging.

# C-specific Things

* Enums.
* Unions.
* Batshit insane pointer manipulation with for loops.
* Complex stopping conditions in for loops.
* #include makes things visible between files based on line of incorporation.
* #defines are pretty nifty.
* Some rudimentary understanding of #ifdef, #ifndef, #endif.
* Assign and check within if statements.
* The ternary operator is wonderful.
* You can iterate multiple things in a for loop. Why don't they teach us this in school, fuq.
* You'll waste time trying to solve things if you don't make sure your Makefile does what you think it does .\_.
* Sockets are pretty cool.

# XOrg Things

* Mostly how the Xlib Window system works (I found a nice picture somewhere but have lost it, and have not gone looking yet).
* That Xlib has a lot of [documentation](https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.pdf) and extra [documentation](https://tronche.com/gui/x/).
* That Xft has no Xfucking documentation.
